# Introduction
This is a simple game for kids to practise their memory.

# Instructions
- Press the buttons in the same order as the leds lit up.
- Starting level is 3 leds, if you press the buttons in the right order (ie. same order as the leds were lit), next level will light up one more led than the previous level (4,5,6 etc).
- The goal is to remember the order of as many lights as possible.
- An "inital sequence" will flash the leds back and forth and then blink them before each game starts.
- If you press the wrong button, the red led will flash and the game will start over.
