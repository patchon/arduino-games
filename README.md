# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of children arduino-games I've been writing for my nephew.
They are really simple and should be easy for most people to understand. The code contains a lot of comments and a pretty verbose output. 

Every game has its own folder that contains a readme and schematics. All schematics are created with the free online tool [easyeda](https://easyeda.com/editor) and can be uploaded and modified according to your needs. 

# Prerequires
In order to be able to build and run these games you'll need to have,
- An Arduino 2560 (or similar)
- Electrical components, such as 
  - A few LED's 
  - A 16x2 LCD display
  - A breadboard
  - Resistors / Potentiometer
  - Cables 
- A little c-programming (arduino) and some elecrical know-how

**Note**

I have very limited knowledge within the c-programming area, and my elecrical know-how is basically google - so don't let that requirement scare you. 

# Get started
Simply dive in to one of the subfolders in this repository and build the game. 
Once built, upload the source code via the Arduino IDE and play.
